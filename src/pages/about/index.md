title: About Julia Jachimowicz
---

### Pre-University Life
A younger Julia was always very passionate about sports, particularly softball. I played for 8 years and fell in love with the game. Today, I do not currently play, but get my fix for the sport watching baseball. Being the only Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays have my support. 

### University 
I pursued a Sociology degree at the University of British Columbia. Throughout my degree I was always interested in a wide breadth of courses. Some of which included: Family Studies, Chemistry, Biology, Math, Graphic Design, Visual Arts, Creative Writing, Psychology and Education. I loved learning about Sociology. I think it is so essential and important to understand the society we live in and how human interaction is structured based on the inequalities and social determinants within our society.

### Lighthouse Labs
Some of my favourite courses in University were statistics and research methods. I had always had a passion for technology, playing with HTML and CSS even before university. I sought out Lighthouse Labs to progress my knowledge in technology. Here I spent many hours learning and working in a 12 week intensive program to achieve full stack development. The course went surprisingly fast and before I knew it my resume looked a whole lot beefier (all jokes aside I learned some really cool things).

### General Interests
When I am not coding, I like to spend my time cheering on my favourite sports teams, spending time with friends, snowboarding (or falling a lot), practicing photography, baking, watching terrible reality television, or sleeping, I really like sleeping.
